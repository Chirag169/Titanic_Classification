# Titanic_Classification
Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger.
Supervised Machine learning Techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, K-nearest neighbours, Neural Network.

Only 3 models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) out of 6 models provide 100% accuracy (i.e. 1.0)

So, I used the Random Forest Classifier to predict all the survivors correctly.
